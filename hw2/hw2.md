This web application has three pages: home page, saved articles, and news article page. When you click on a saved article, the page will be directed to saved article page. A detailed news article page will be shown when you click on each story.

At the top, there is a navigation bar that includes the name, logo, search bar, and several buttons. Users can easily use functions when they scan the page. The navigation bar is consistent across all the pages. The logo, search bar, and function buttons are evenly spread out across the screen so visually it is not too crowded. We use plain language to show saved articles and favourite articles with icons that match the real-world situation. This ensures visibility of system status so that users do not get lost when they are on different pages. 

The Home page is displaying a summary of news articles and all the functionalities so that user control is maximized. We believe the design principle “Less is more” is reflected on our web. We choose to use light color frames and keep everything simple so that users do not feel overwhelmed.  

In order to increase the efficiency of choosing favourite articles or saving articles, saved articles and favourite articles icons are displayed whenever articles are visible. Users can have the flexibility to change their lists of favourite/saved articles.
