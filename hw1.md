What are you building?
We are building a single-page application for searching news according to your interest using the NEWS API. 
You can search the most popular headlines for specific categories, countries, and specific sources.
 We will have input from users and show them the content of the news. In addition, users can have their news articles saved in the saved list so that they can always check. 
(depend on time) They can post comments to the articles to record their thoughts. 
(depend on time) We provide sign-in authentication (preferably using google authentication) so that everyone can have their own news portfolio.
What does it do or what kind of problem does it solve?
This single-page application is a news portfolio/blog app. The purpose is to provide users with a platform to save news articles that they are interested in. They can have news/headlines layouts in a clear and appropriate order.
What are the key features of your system?
It will connect with a news API and display news articles related to the user’s search. The user will be able to save selected articles to read later, as well as favourite articles. We will use local storage for storing the articles on the client’s side. 
Provide a sample architecture diagram of your system (you can use PPT with squares and circles to demonstrate a simplified flow of your system) 




Describe the team approach to the project work: how are you planning to distribute the workload, how are you managing your code, and how are you planning to test your system. 
We will split the project into smaller pieces and let each member group take on some components - for instance, coding the grid for displaying articles, getting articles from the NEWS API, and making sure the app is responsive to different screens will all be separate tasks. Each member is responsible for end-to-end work including the UI design, coding, and unit test. Any feature will be made and reviewed by the whole team.
